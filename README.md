Zabbix User Parameters
======================

[Zabbix](http://zabbix.com/documentation) can be extended by defining custom [User Parameters](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.4/manual/config/items/userparameters) to monitor metrics that were not available out of the box. This is accomplished by deploying config and executable scripts on the host that will be monitored, and then setting up the Zabbix server to probe, report and issue alerts for these user parameters.
